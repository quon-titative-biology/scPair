# scPair is a computational framework for boosting single cell multimodal analysis by leveraging single cell atlases and implicit feature selection

scPair, a deep learning framework for computational analysis of single cell multimodal data. scPair performs automatic, implicit feature selection to infer the features of each data modality that yield optimal mappings of cell states between data modalities. Our training procedure of scPair also addresses challenges of shallow sequencing of multimodal datasets by using higher depth unimodal data to learn robust covariance structure in each data modality, and in turn relies on multimodal data primarily for feature selection and integration of cell states between data modalities. We demonstrate that these two properties of scPair enable it to outperform existing methods on multimodal data analysis tasks such as cell state mapping and feature prediction, as well as simultaneous trajectory inference in both RNA and ATAC data components to identify time point-specific feature activity during cellular differentiation.
